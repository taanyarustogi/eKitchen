# eKitchen

A prototype of an app that users can use to store what ingredients are avaliable in their kitchen and use AI to generate recipes based on the ingredients they have. They can also chose to complete making a recipe and the app automatically removes the ingredients from the pantry in the app and adds it to a shopping list if the item is finished. When shopping, users can check off the items they buy and remove it from the shopping list and add it to their pantry in the app with one button.
